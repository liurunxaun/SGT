Now multiply 5 through the parentheses: 3r + 5r + 10 = 42
Now add like terms to get 8r + 10 = 42
Now subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: 8r = 32

She earns $5 per 10 minutes, so for the online task she earns in total 150 * 5/10=$<<150*5/10=75>>75.

In total they have 42 points + 18 points + 21 points = <<42+18+21=81>>81 points.

So, the 5 members consume 0.4 kg/day/person x 5 people = <<0.4*5=2>>2 kg of rice per day.
In a week, the household consumes 2 kg/day x 7 days/week = <<2*7=14>>14kg of rice.

Carmen also has to bid against each person, so she also adds 3 bids * $50 per bid = $<<3*50=150>>150 to the overall cost.
So in these bids, there has been a total of $150 + $150 = $<<150+150=300>>300 added to the initial cost of the desk.
The desk therefore costs $200 opening bid + $300 added cost = $<<200+300=500>>500.
